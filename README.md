# The role of NMDA in dendritic integration

Here is the code used in the following paper:

Diverse role of NMDA receptors for dendritic integration of neural dynamics. Yuanhong Tang, Xingyu Zhang, Lingling An, Zhaofei Yu, 
Jian K. Liu.

NEURON.zip includes the code based on the NEURON package (https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). 

The code was developed based on many previous work, including the following one and other models in the NEURON ModelDB (https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb):

Using Strahler√≠s analysis to reduce up to 200-fold the run time of realistic neuron models, by A. Marasco, A.Limongiello, and M.Migliore
(2013) Sci. Rep. 3, 2934; DOI:10.1038/srep02934.

The code was also used for the following work: 

An, L., Tang, Y., Wang, Q., Pei, Q., Wei, R., Duan, H., and Liu, J. K., Coding Capacity of Purkinje Cells with Different Schemes of Morphological Reduction, Frontier in Computational Neuroscience 13:29 (2019) [PDF] DOI: 10.3389/fncom.2019.00029

# The role of NMDA in dendritic integration

Here is the code used in the following papers:

Diverse role of NMDA receptors for dendritic integration of neural dynamics. Tang Y., Zhang X., An L., Yu Z., Liu, J. K.

Coding Capacity of Purkinje Cells with Different Schemes of Morphological Reduction, An, L., Tang, Y., Wang, Q., Pei, Q., Wei, R., Duan, H., and Liu, J. K., Frontier in Computational Neuroscience 13:29 DOI:[10.3389/fncom.2019.00029](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00029/full).

NEURON.zip includes the code based on the [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). 

The code was developed based on many previous works/models in the NEURON [ModelDB](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb), particularly the following one:

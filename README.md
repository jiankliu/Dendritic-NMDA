# The role of NMDA in dendritic integration

Here is the code used in the following paper:

Diverse role of NMDA receptors for dendritic integration of neural dynamics. Tang Y., Zhang X., An L., Yu Z., Liu, J. K.

The zip file includes the code based on the [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). The code was developed based on many previous works/models in the NEURON [ModelDB](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb), where one can find various types of detailed neuropnal models.

The similar code was used for the following papers:

Coding Capacity of Purkinje Cells with Different Schemes of Morphological Reduction, An, L., Tang, Y., Wang, Q., Pei, Q., Wei, R., Duan, H., and Liu, J. K., Frontier in Computational Neuroscience 13:29 DOI:[10.3389/fncom.2019.00029](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00029/full).

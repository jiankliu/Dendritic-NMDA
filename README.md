# The role of NMDA in dendritic integration

Here is the code used in the following paper:

Diverse role of NMDA receptors for dendritic integration of neural dynamics. Yuanhong Tang, Xingyu Zhang, Lingling An, Zhaofei Yu, 
Jian K. Liu.

NEURON.zip includes the code based on the [NEURON](https://neuron.yale.edu/neuron/). 

The code was developed based on many previous work and models in the NEURON [ModelDB](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/modeldb). Particularly the following one: 

Using Strahler√≠s analysis to reduce up to 200-fold the run time of realistic neuron models, by A. Marasco, A.Limongiello, and M.Migliore
(2013) Sci. Rep. 3, 2934; DOI:[10.1038/srep02934](https://doi.org/10.1038/srep02934).

The similar code was also used for the following work: 

An, L., Tang, Y., Wang, Q., Pei, Q., Wei, R., Duan, H., and Liu, J. K., Coding Capacity of Purkinje Cells with Different Schemes of Morphological Reduction, Frontier in Computational Neuroscience 13:29 DOI:[10.3389/fncom.2019.00029](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2019.00029/full).
